# The Most Dangerous Game
---
To start, The Most Dangerous Game bares no relation to the novel by the same name.\
Instead, it refers to this augmented reality game I made using a Python Flask App and\
Javascript. Through a rudimentary UI, establish points correlating to\
real-life places using their latitude and longitude, create teams, and create users\
tied to those teams for players to use.\

**How it works**
